# Render2016_RenderingTheObvious
Source code of my Render 2016 talk, a Java/Processing project in Eclipse 

https://processing.org/

Human models and morphing targets from MakeHuman: http://www.makehuman.org/

Images used:
* normal rainbow: unattributed
* "double" rainbow: Shanana Rocks, 8/01/2010
* "full" rainbow: unattributed
 

Controls:
* next slide: spacebar
* prev slide: backspace (Warning: not completely debugged will crash certain slides)
* Some slides respond to mouse left-click (next phase of slide, increase raytrace depth),... and mouse right-click (increase reflection intensity)

Have fun and break stuff,

Frederik
